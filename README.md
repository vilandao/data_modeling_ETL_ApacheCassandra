## Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. 
The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate 
the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

For this project, we'll create an Apache Cassandra database which and create queries on song play data to answer some business questions. 

The purpose of the NoSQL database is to answer queries on song play data. The data model includes a table for each of the following queries:

1. Give me the artist, song title and song's length in the music app history that was heard during  sessionId = 338, and itemInSession  = 4

2. Give me only the following: name of artist, song (sorted by itemInSession) and user (first and last name) for userid = 10, sessionid = 182
    
3. Give me every user name (first and last) in my music app history who listened to the song 'All Hands Against His Own'

### Requirements for running locally
- Python3 
- Jupiter notebook

### Database keyspace design
Below is the database keyspace for the Sparkify databse:

### Data pre-processing, ETL pipeline, and data modeling

The data are stored as a collection of csv files partitioned by date. The ETL pipeline and data modeling are written in a single jupyter notebook, **etl_cassandra.ipynb**.

ETL copies data from the date-partitioned csv files to a single csv file **event_datafile_new.csv** which is used to populate the denormalized Cassandra tables optimised for the 3 queries above. The 3 tables in the model are named after the song play query they are created to solve:

1. **`session_history`** includes artist, song title and song length information for a given `sessionId` and `itemInSessionId`.

2. **`user_songs`** includes artist, song and user for a given `userId` and `sessionId`.

3. **`app_history`** includes user names for a given song.
